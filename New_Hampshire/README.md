After receiving your first shot you will recieve a Vaccine Card which will outline which vaccine you received. 
On the back of the card will be the date you receive your second vaccine, Unless otherwise noted your appointment will be for the same time as the first shot.
Simply show up to the same vaccine location you got your first shot and provide your vaccine card.
